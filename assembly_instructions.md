# Assembly Instructions

Congratulations! Assuming you've ordered the parts, found the requisite tools, printed the case, and downloaded the firmware, you are about to assemble LetMeIn v2! Please don't burn your house down. I'd recommend getting a really good pair of helping hands for this.

1. Solder headers onto TinyS2. There's a lot of them, but they're quick to solder with a fine tip and good solder wire. Use a breadboard to hold the headers in place while you solder them, but be careful not to melt the plastic of the headers!

2. Solder the TinyS2 to the board. Make certain it goes in straight and even, so it lies flat. I'd recommend starting with the corners of the board. When you're done, get a pair of cutters and remove excess legs.

3. Solder the resistors. It looks nicer if they're all oriented the same way. Bend them so they stay in place in the board while you solder, then get a pair of flush cutters and cut the joints as flat as you can.

4. Solder the rest of the headers to the board. They should all be male. Female wires make this so much easier later, trust me. Use the bench to keep the headers level while you solder them.

5. Solder the piezo buzzer. I used an alligator clip on my helping hands to keep it in place while I worked. Be sure you have the polarity right.

6. Place the board in the box and hot glue it into place.
    - _Note, on the final revision, I will have the posts that keep the board in place figured out._

7. Solder the STFU button & LED to headers. Wire length here should be about 90mm. 
    - Hot glue the components into place, and be sure to use lots so the button doesn't dislodge when pressed.
    - **Warning: Ensure that everything is properly aligned before doing this**
    - Make sure to leave enough room for both components.

8. Insert LEDs into front panel. The positive ends should face the speaker grill. Bend them down and clip them short. (Be sure to clip the positive and negative ends at different lengths so you know which is which)
    - This will (hopefully) change. It doesn't look great, and it's not easy to do.
    - But it's small and fits well.

9. **Now is a good time to test fit the button.**

10. Cut and solder a 60mm wire to the button, then install it. Make sure the button's collard does not interfere with the top case.

11. Profit.
